If you've been looking for new Atom packages to try out, here's a few neat ones we noticed since the [last package roundup post](/blog/2014/06/23/new-package-roundup). Enjoy!

## [Pain Split](/packages/pain-split)

This package by [@vidius](https://github.com/vidius) extends the default set of commands for splitting panes so that you can create an empty file in the new pane or move the active tab into the new pane. Best package name ever.

## [Ask StackOverflow](/packages/ask-stack)

Stuck working on your project or homework? This package can help! Quickly find answers and code samples from Stack Overflow directly from Atom. Great work [@chris911](https://github.com/chris911)!

## [Git Blame](/packages/git-blame)

If looking at Git blame is a part of your workflow, this handy package created by [@alexcorre](https://github.com/alexcorre) helps you do that right from Atom. Works with submodules, and allows one-click access to commit pages on remote repositories (GitHub, Bitbucket, or your remote of choice).

## [Jumpy](/packages/jumpy) and [Easy Motion](/packages/easy-motion)

Jumpy, from [@DavidLGoldberg](https://github.com/DavidLGoldberg), creates dynamic hot keys to quickly jump around files and across visible panes.

## [TODO Show](/packages/todo-show)

This package from [@jamischarles](https://github.com/jamischarles) finds all TODO, FIXME and CHANGED comments in your project and shows them nicely organized in a pane. You can also configure the package to find other types of comments.

## Seti Theme: [Seti UI](/themes/seti-ui) and [Seti Syntax](/themes/seti-syntax)

This dark-colored theme, created by [@jesseweed](https://github.com/jesseweed), has been one of our favorites for a while. It ships with custom file icons and a great syntax color scheme, so make sure you give it a try.
