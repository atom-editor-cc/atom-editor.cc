## [Pain Split](https://atom.io/packages/pain-split)

This package by [@vidius](https://github.com/vidius) extends the default set of commands for splitting panes so that you can create an empty file in the new pane or move the active tab into the new pane. Best package name ever.

## [Git Blame](https://atom.io/packages/git-blame)

If looking at Git blame is a part of your workflow, this handy package created by [@alexcorre](https://github.com/alexcorre) helps you do that right from Atom. Works with submodules, and allows one-click access to commit pages on remote repositories (GitHub, Bitbucket, or your remote of choice).
