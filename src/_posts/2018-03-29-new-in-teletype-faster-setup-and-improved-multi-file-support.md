Today's Teletype release makes it even easier to start coding together. In addition, you now have more flexibility when collaborating on multiple files. [Install the update](https://teletype.atom.io/#getting-started) to take advantage of these improvements.

### Joining a portal is as easy as clicking a link

With Teletype 0.11, you'll spend less time _getting ready_ to collaborate so that you have more time for _actually collaborating_.

Invite coworkers or friends to collaborate by sending them a link to your portal. Collaborators simply follow that link to start coding with you in real time.

### Collaborate on multiple files simultaneously

Hosts can add files to their workspace to share those files with guests. To make a file available for collaboration, open a new tab containing that file. To stop sharing the file, simply close the tab.

Collaborators can follow along with the host (or any other collaborator), or they can edit shared files independently. And with [Atom 1.26](/blog/2018/03/15/atom-1-25#atom-126-beta), collaborators can use the [fuzzy-finder](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/atom-basics/#opening-a-file-in-a-project) to quickly open any file shared by the host.
