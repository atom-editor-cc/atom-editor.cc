title: "MuleSoft's New API Workbench is built on Atom"
---

A big part of the mission behind Atom is to create a shared community foundation on which people can build amazing developer tools. We'd like to occasionally showcase new and interesting things built on top of Atom.

One of the latest projects to harness the extensibility and power of Atom is MuleSoft's new [API Workbench](http://apiworkbench.com/).

API Workbench is designed to help developers design, build, test, document and share REST APIs. With integrated tools that promote reusability and consistency, it helps add simplicity and structure to every part of the API management process. API Workbench marries the core editing and design tools that API developers need with the more modern capabilities they've come to expect. And since API Workbench is built around [RAML](http://raml.org/), it uses a design-first approach that promotes longer-term efficiency.

Here's how Uri Sarid, MuleSoft CTO, explains it:

> "The API economy is here and growing, with APIs transforming into significant business drivers across industries. A key success to making the API economy work is to have good API design from the beginningâ€”an approach that is championed by the thriving RAML community. By contributing API Workbench to the RAML community, we're building on our commitment to RAML and its design-first approach to APIs. The slick new IDE aligns with RAML's primary design principle to be as simple as possible to write and read APIs, and to promote reusability and consistency."

MuleSoft has built a ton of intelligence and automation around creating and consuming APIs with RAML. Here are a few features we really liked:

- An interactive API console
- Graphical API creation tools
- Live RAML debugging
- RAML autocomplete support
- RAML refactoring tools
- Integration with the community-built [linter](/packages/linter) for RAML
