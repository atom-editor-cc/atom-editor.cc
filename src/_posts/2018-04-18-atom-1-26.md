Atom 1.26 has been released on our stable channel and includes GitHub package improvements, fuzzy-finder support for Teletype and file system watcher improvements.

<!--more-->

### GitHub package improvements

The GitHub package's Git pane now [displays a list of recent commits](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1322) for quick reference:

![commits](/assets/images/user-images.githubusercontent.com/378023/36707789-40983692-1bb3-11e8-9530-b745da44da52.gif)

This list is read-only for now but will become more interactive in future releases.

The Git authentication dialog also gained a ["Remember"](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1327) checkbox to enable you to store your username and password:

![remember](/assets/images/user-images.githubusercontent.com/378023/36955667-2affb9d6-206d-11e8-9b57-1eab0d299e82.gif)

Your credentials are saved securely in your operating system's credential store so that they can be used for future Git operations.

### Fuzzy-finder support for Teletype

When you're coding together with [Teletype](https://teletype.atom.io/), you can now use the [fuzzy-finder](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/atom-basics/#opening-a-file-in-a-project) to quickly open any file shared by the host.

![Use Atom's fuzzy-finder to open remote buffers shared by the host via Teletype](/assets/images/user-images.githubusercontent.com/2988/37472427-72599aa4-2842-11e8-8777-3976ae6f2899.gif)

Atom's fuzzy-finder is your one-stop shop for lightning-fast access to the local files and the remote files in your workspace.

### File system watcher improvements

Our file system watchers will now fall back to polling if the operating system is unable to watch for events. You can manually force watching to be done through polling by setting "File System Watcher" to "Polling" if the detection fails, which may be necessary on certain kinds of remotely mounted drives.

We've also added an [experimental file system watcher](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16124) to lower resource consumption, improve scalability when watching many directories, and achieve greater parity with the information available from the operating system. Please give it a try by changing the core "File System Watcher" setting to "Experimental".

### GitHub package improvements

Pair programming enthusiasts rejoice: GitHub package now supports adding multiple [co-authors](https://blog.github.com/2018-01-29-commit-together-with-co-authors/" title="learn more about co-authorship on GitHub.com) to [any commit](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1355" title="pull request for the co authors feature). You can search by name or email to add previous committers as co-authors. If your co-author hasn't committed to the current repository before, don't worry - you can still [give them the credit they deserve](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1374" title="pull request for adding a new co author).

Amend functionality, once a checkbox, has now been expanded to an [Undo button and action on the context menu](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1364) of the recent commit list.

For when it comes time to submit your work for review, we now offer a quick way to [create a PR right from the GitHub pane](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1376), pushing any commits if necessary. With just a button click, we will launch GitHub.com in your browser so that you can fill in the PR description, assign reviewers, and then submit it.

We've streamlined the experience for [pushing and pulling branches from the status bar](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1308) so that the action it takes is based on the status of your branch relative to its remote. This should save you a few clicks per day on common remote interactions. You can still access explicit push/pull actions by right-clicking the status bar item.
