With Atom 1.35 comes a fix for the recent Chrome vulnerability, ability to view the full diff for pull requests directly within Atom, and a variety of enhancements and stability improvements.

<!--more-->

### Chrome Vulnerability Fix

You might have heard about a [high-severity vulnerability in Chrome](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2019/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html), involving remote code execution. Electron has [published a fix](https://electronjs.org/blog/filereader-fix), which we have pulled into Atom. Be diligent about upgrading any other apps you run that are powered by Chromium.

### Commit Details

Have you ever committed some changes, had a brain fart, and then thought to yourself "what the heck did I just write?" ![:scream:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f631.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":scream:"}  Worry not â€” now you can more easily perform code archaeology in the comfort of your editor. The GitHub package now supports [viewing the contents of any commit in a pane](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1807). To try it out, you can either click on a commit in the "Recent Commits" view, or you can use the command palette (`github:open-commit`) and input the SHA of any commit in the current repository. Good news for keyboard users, too: the recent commits view now supports keyboard navigation.

### Pull Request Diffs

The GitHub pull request view has a new tab that [shows all files changed in that pull request](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1829). It allows users to view pull requests diffs without context switching to GitHub.com, and brings us one step closer to code review in the editor.

### Community Contribution Highlights

Shout out to contributor [@karevn](https://github.com/karevn) for making it so that  [`File -> Open` works even if there are no open Atom windows](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/17529).

Do you love trying to log in when you can't see what you're typing? Neither do we! Props to community contributor [@ericcornelissen](https://github.com/ericcornelissen) for adding the ability to [show and hide password text in the SSH password field](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1808).

There are many more details in the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.35.0).

## Atom 1.36 Beta

Atom 1.36 gives you a faster fuzzy finder, comments in the GitHub pull request view, and a smoother Atom upgrade process on macOS and Windows.

### Fuzzy Finder Performance

Once upon a time, there was a noticeable lag between when you opened Atom with a large repository, and when you could use the fuzzy finder to actually open files. Thanks to some smart detective work, fuzzy finder performance is now much improved!  This release [shaves a whopping 40%](https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder/pull/366) off the time it takes to index files in medium and large repositories.

### Smoother Atom Upgrades

We have heard from users that Atom updates can be a headache, and we are listening. Now, Atom users on macOS will [no longer have to restart Atom twice](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/18775) during the update process. For our Windows users, we've [fixed an unfortunate regression](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/18750) that caused Atom to believe it couldn't automatically update on Windows while `core.automaticallyUpdate` was set to `false`.

### GitHub Package Improvements

The GitHub package now allows you to [read comments on pull requests](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1856) without leaving the comfort of your editor. You can also [collapse and expand](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1913) any files within multi-file diff views (such as commit preview and the pull request files view). Large files are collapsed by default, because you probably don't need to see those 800 lines of `package-lock.json` changes in such great detail. (And if you do, just expand them!)

![pull requests comments](/assets/images/user-images.githubusercontent.com/378023/52465966-f32de880-2bc3-11e9-8de5-2d93dd42920c.png)

Also, keyboard shortcuts for finding text [now work within the diff view](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1922). That'll make it easier to remove all those forgotten `console.log()` statements you were about to commit.

### Community Contribution Highlights

Get ready for some love to the settings view from longtime maintainers. Thanks to [@arcanemagus](https://github.com/arcanemagus), [settings view now uses the repository URL defined by atom.io](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/pull/1119), preventing potential author impersonation issues. [Single quotes are now escaped correctly in CSON files](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/pull/1109) thanks to [@aerijo](https://github.com/aerijo), so go forth and copy paste from your snippets file.

Sometimes, better empty states fill the emptiness inside. All jokes aside, props to first time contributor [@robertrossmann](https://github.com/robertrossmann) for polishing the [remote selector and no remove views](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1927).

Writing code isn't the only way to contribute to Atom. Bug reports are also a crucial component of a healthy open source project. Props to [@issacgerges](https://github.com/issacgerges) for [reporting a problem with the keybinding resolver incorrectly resolving non-Latin characters](https://github.com/atom/atom-keymap/issues/237), which we were able to [fix](https://github.com/atom/atom-keymap/pull/238) in this release.
