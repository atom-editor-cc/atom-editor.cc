## Major Changes in 1.7.0 Stable

Below is a summary of the noteworthy changes in Atom 1.7. If you want to see every PR that went into Atom 1.7, check out the [Atom 1.7.0 release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.7.0).

### Most Recently Used Tab Switching

In Atom 1.7, `ctrl-tab` will switch between the most recently used (MRU) tabs in an Atom window instead of switching to the tab to the right of the current tab.

MRU tab switching was a [heavily requested feature](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5344), but if you want the old behavior back, you can overwrite the associated keybinds (using the [new keyup syntax](#keyup-keystroke-support-in-keybinds)) in your [Keymap file](https://flight-manual.atom-editor.cc/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/#_customizing_keybindings):

```coffee
'body':
  'ctrl-tab ^ctrl': 'unset!'
  'ctrl-tab': 'pane:show-next-item'
  'ctrl-shift-tab ^ctrl': 'unset!'
  'ctrl-shift-tab': 'pane:show-previous-item'
```

### Opening and Managing Files from the Tree View

Atom 1.7 brings some changes to the way clicking on files in the tree view behaves, making it easier to select files for operations like renaming and deleting and more closely matching the behavior of other editors.

If you have [pending pane items](/blog/2016/03/17/atom-1-6-and-1-7-beta#pending-pane-items) enabled, then single-clicking an item in the tree view will open the file in pending mode but leave the focus in the tree view; _double_-clicking the file will switch the file to permanent mode and focus the editor.

![Single Click to Focus Tree View](/assets/images/blog.atom.io/img/posts/single-click-tree-view-pending-on.gif)

With pending pane items disabled, single-clicking a file in the tree view will only select it, and double-clicking it will open it for editing and focus the editor.

- [atom/tree-view#749 - Clicking on file in tree view that isn't open sets focus on editor](https://github.com/atom/tree-view/issues/749)
- [atom/tree-view#801 - Keep focus on single click and update to use 1.6stable pending items api](https://github.com/atom/tree-view/pull/801)
- [atom/tree-view#803 - Don't open file on single-click unless core.allowPendingPaneItems=true](https://github.com/atom/tree-view/pull/803)

### Adding Project Folders from the Command Line

Atom now supports the `--add` swich (aliased to `-a`) which will add the passed directory as a project folder to the most recently focused Atom window instead of opening that folder in its own window.

![Add Project Folderes from Command Line](/assets/images/blog.atom.io/img/posts/atom-add-command-line.gif)

- [atom/atom#10841 - Add the -a, –add CLI option](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10841)

### Keyup Keystroke Support in Keybinds

Atom's [Keymap file](https://flight-manual.atom-editor.cc/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/#_customizing_keybindings) now supports a new syntax for dispatching events on keyup events. For example,

```coffee
'atom-workspace':
  'ctrl-y ^ctrl': 'core:do-stuff'
```

means that the `core:do-stuff` command will be dispatched when the user presses `ctrl-y` and then _releases_ the `ctrl` key. If any other binding is used instead of or after the `ctrl-y`, the command will not be dispatched.

You can also specify multiple events in a sequence:

```coffee
'atom-workspace':
  'a b c ^c ^a ^b': 'core:secret-triple-command'
```

This command would be dispatched when the user presses `a`, `b`, `c`, then releases `c`, `b`, `a`; however, releasing `a`, `b`, then `c` would not dispatch the event.

Check out the [relevant PR](https://github.com/atom/atom-keymap/pull/113) for all the details!

### Crash Recovery

Crashes are nobody's idea of fun, but in case Atom does crash on you, it periodically saves your editor state. After relaunching Atom after a crash, you should find all your work saved and ready to go.

To reset Atom's serialized state, start Atom with `--clear-window-state`; the previous method of deleting `~/.atom/storage` no longer works.

- [atom/atom#10605 - Periodically save state and store in IndexedDB](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10605)
- [atom/atom#11060 - Serialize MarkerLayers only on quit](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11060)
- [atom/text-buffer#136 - Redesign History and Improve serialization performance](https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/pull/136)
- [atom/atom-patch#7 - Add FlatBuffers serialization](https://github.com/atom/atom-patch/pull/7)

### Environment Per Window

Each Atom window can now have its own environment; if you use packages that rely on certain environment variables being set for particular language or project workflows, you no longer have to relaunch Atom to get the right environment variables.

- [atom/atom#11054 - Patch Environment On OSX And Allow A Different Environment Per Window](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11054)

### Packages Using Async Git

A whole slew of packages have been updated to use the [new async Git](/blog/2016/03/17/atom-1-6-and-1-7-beta#async-git) module, resulting in performance improvements across the board when these packages access Git data.

- [atom/atom#10843 - Bump packages to use async git](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10843)

### Electron Update

Atom's version of [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) has been bumped from 0.34 to 0.36, providing newer versions of Chrome and Node.js and a number of bug fixes. Chrome is now at version 47, and Node.js is at 5.1.1.

- [atom/atom#9627 - Update to Electron 0.36](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9627)

### Windows Improvements

1.7 brings a number of improvements to the Atom experience on Windows.

- **Build** [documentation](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/docs/build-instructions/windows.md) clarifies [how to build in VS 2015](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10747); the [clean script handles NPM2 long paths](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10874) and [Appveyor CI builds support added](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9477/commits/19334be18825781967161279786cc3807598ae93)

- **Installation** conditions where the [PATH would not be correctly set](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10326) have been addressed as well as ensuring [pinned shortcuts are updated when Atom updates](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10858) and other improvements from the latest [Squirrel installer](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows) such as .msi packages and draggable splash panel.
- **Command line** [–wait switch works from Command Prompt, PowerShell](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11053) and [Bash](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11103) allowing you to specify Atom as your commit message editor with
`git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"`

- **Portable mode** is now [documented in the Flight Manual](https://flight-manual.atom-editor.cc/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/#atom-on-windows).
- **Downloads** from [atom.io](/) using Internet Explorer on Windows 7 now have .exe extension.
- Some **Git** issues [have been resolved](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11022).
- **File types** can be easily [associated with Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10818). No more need to hunt for atom.exe or deal with broken associations after an update. _Note: Installing Atom does not take over any file associations._
