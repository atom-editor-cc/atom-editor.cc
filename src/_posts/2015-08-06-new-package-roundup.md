Our last package roundup was in [May](/blog/2015/05/21/new-package-roundup), before [Atom 1.0](/blog/2015/06/25/atom-1-0) was released, so we decided to share a few new packages we've tried out since then. As always, you can check out the full list of packages and themes on [Atom.io](https://atom.io/packages).

# [Expose](https://atom.io/packages/expose)

Similar to Mac OSX Exposé, this package from [@mrodalgaard](https://github.com/mrodalgaard) gives you an overview of open files. The package can also integrate with the [Minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap) package for content previews and the [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons) package for tab icons.

# [iMDone](https://atom.io/packages/imdone-atom)

This package gives you a task-board interface similar to Trello for TODO comments, FIXMEs, and HACKs in your code. Great work, [@imdone](https://github.com/imdone) team!

# Focus themes - [dark](https://atom.io/packages/focus-dark) and [light](https://atom.io/packages/focus-light)

[@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) created these neat themes that let you focus on the content while editing files. There's a dark and a light variant, and they both work really well with HTML, Markdown, and LaTeX files.

# [Multi wrap guide](https://atom.io/packages/multi-wrap-guide)

If you always wanted more and more powerful wrap guides in Atom, then this package from [@lexicalunit](https://github.com/lexicalunit) is for you. You can add and remove wrap guides from the context menu, change their position by dragging, and also create horizontal guides.
