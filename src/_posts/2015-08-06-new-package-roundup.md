Our last package roundup was in [May](/blog/2015/05/21/new-package-roundup), before [Atom 1.0](/blog/2015/06/25/atom-1-0) was released, so we decided to share a few new packages we've tried out since then. As always, you can check out the full list of packages and themes on [Atom.io](/packages).

# [Expose](/packages/expose)

# [iMDone](/packages/imdone-atom)

This package gives you a task-board interface similar to Trello for TODO comments, FIXMEs, and HACKs in your code. Great work, [@imdone](https://github.com/imdone) team!

# Focus themes - [dark](/packages/focus-dark) and [light](/packages/focus-light)

[@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) created these neat themes that let you focus on the content while editing files. There's a dark and a light variant, and they both work really well with HTML, Markdown, and LaTeX files.

# [Multi wrap guide](/packages/multi-wrap-guide)
