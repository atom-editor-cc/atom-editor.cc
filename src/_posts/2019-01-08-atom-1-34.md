Atom 1.34 is out! With this release, you'll enjoy a host of enhancements to help you craft the perfect commit, including a faster diff view, the ability to preview all staged changes, and support for commit message templates.

### Commit Previews

Are you the conscientious sort, who loves to double check the specific changes that are going into each commit?  When crafting commit messages, do you have a desire to draw inspiration from the diff of your staged changes?  If so, you're going to love the [commit preview](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1767) feature. Just click the "See All Staged Changes" button above the commit message box, and you'll see all of your staged changes in a single pane.

### Improved Diffs

Calling performance enthusiasts: the GitHub package now [renders diff views with a `TextEditor`](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1512). `TextEditor` offers many performance enhancements, allowing us to render large diffs faster. Furthermore, your text editor key bindings now work in diffs.

### Commit Message Templates

Thanks to community contributor [@gauravchl](https://github.com/gauravchl), Atom now supports [commit message templates](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1756). You can add a template on a per-project basis or globally through your [git configuration](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration). The template text will then appear in the commit input box within Atom.

### Community Contribution Highlights

When editing markdown code blocks, the Kotlin language now has [syntax highlighting](https://github.com/atom/language-gfm/pull/236). Thanks [@radixdev](https://github.com/radixdev) for your first-time contribution to Atom.

Long time volunteer maintainer [@50Wliu](https://github.com/50Wliu) [fixed](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/pull/1065) a nasty bug where package searches from the settings view were [throwing uncaught exceptions](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/issues/1052).

Thanks to first-time contributor [@edahlseng](https://github.com/edahlseng), you can now [collapse all directories in the tree view](https://github.com/atom/tree-view/pull/1287) even if nothing is selected.

## Atom 1.35 Beta

With Atom 1.35 Beta comes quick access to details for recent commits, ability to view the full diff for pull requests directly within Atom, and a variety of enhancements and stability improvements.

### Commit Details

Have you ever committed some changes, had a brain fart, and then thought to yourself "what the heck did I just write?" ![:scream:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f631.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":scream:"}  Worry not â€” now you can more easily perform code archaeology in the comfort of your editor. The GitHub package now supports [viewing the contents of any commit in a pane](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1807). To try it out, you can either click on a commit in the "Recent Commits" view, or you can use the command palette (`github:open-commit`) and input the SHA of any commit in the current repository. Good news for keyboard users, too: the recent commits view now supports keyboard navigation.

### Pull Request Diffs

The GitHub pull request view has a new tab that [shows all files changed in that pull request](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1829). It allows users to view pull requests diffs without context switching to GitHub.com, and brings us one step closer to code review in the editor.

### Community Contribution Highlights

Do you love trying to log in when you can't see what you're typing? Neither do we! Props to community contributor [@ericcornelissen](https://github.com/ericcornelissen) for adding the ability to [show and hide password text in the SSH password field](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1808).
