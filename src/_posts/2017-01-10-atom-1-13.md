### Atom Benchmarks

In our continuous mission to improve Atom's performance, 1.13 introduces [benchmarks](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12984) to better quantify improvements or ![:scream:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f631.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":scream:"} regressions.

### Reopen Project

Want to get Atom back to a previous state without figuring out the command line incantation? There's now a [Reopen Project](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13046) menu item, palette command, and API.

### New Octicons

A new version of the Octicons is now bundled in Atom with improvements to line-weight and sizing normalization. In addition [20 new icons](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13138) are available. ![:tada:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":tada:"}

### Keystroke Resolver API

To help address the long tail of unusual international keyboard behaviors as interpreted by Chrome, particularly on Linux, Atom 1.13 includes a [custom keystroke resolver API](https://github.com/atom/atom-keymap/pull/164) allowing users to assign Chrome keyboard events to Atom-style keystrokes.

### Shadow DOM Removal

This release marks [the end of Atom's failed experiment](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12903) using the Shadow DOM as a way to isolate the editor from unintended CSS. Check out the [in-depth post](/blog/2016/11/14/removing-shadow-dom-boundary-from-text-editor-elements) for details.

### Usability Improvements

- [Allow reordering project folders via drag and drop](https://github.com/atom/tree-view/pull/525)
- [Optional full-width status bar](https://github.com/atom/status-bar/pull/152)
- [Follow-through tooltip behavior](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13095)
- [Don't show find panel when doing cmd-e](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/pull/796)

### Performance Boosters

- [Don't construct placeholder tokenized lines](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12933)
- [Avoid forcing computation of all screen lines when opening a file](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12898)

Don't forget to check out all the other improvements shipping with this version in the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.13.0)! ![:memo:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":memo:"}

### Large File Performance

A fundamental data structure in the editor has been [implemented in native code](https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/pull/185) to reduce memory and yield better performance for large files.

Atom 1.14 makes available a [64-bit installation](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13135) for Windows! ![:tada:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":tada:"}

### MRU Tab Traversal

There was some—lets call it _pointed_—feedback about our initial implementation of most-recently-used tab traversal that we've addressed in this release:

- An MRU-ordered list of the tabs to visit now appears during MRU traversal.
- There is an option in the tabs package settings to make ctrl-tab and ctrl-shift-tab do MRU or simple left/right traversal.
- Fixed a bug in keyup handling such that the MRU order doesn't appear to randomly change.

### Other Noteworthy 1.14 improvements:

- [Overhaul of the bundled C# grammar](https://github.com/atom/language-csharp/pull/87)
- [Upgrade find-and-replace to use new marker layer API for fast clearing of markers](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13516)
- [Option for avoiding overlay movements](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11852)
- [Reduce the impact of leaking Editor, Selection, & Cursor objects](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13523)

There are many more details in the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.14.0-beta0).
