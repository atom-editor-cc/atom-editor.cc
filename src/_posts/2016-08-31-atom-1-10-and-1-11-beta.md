Hot on the heels of the last release, we've released [Atom v1.10](https://atom.io/) and [v1.11-beta](https://atom.io/beta)!

## 1.10 Stable

Here are some of the noteworthy changes that are shipping to Stable in 1.10. Thanks to our diligent beta users for helping us test these out and ensure that they deserve the stable designation ![:tada:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":tada:"}

### Atom Package Manager Upgrade

The new version of apm runs on Node 4.4.5 and npm 3.10.5. This has a number of benefits including:

- Package dependencies are now flattened by npm 3, reducing problems with paths exceeding the path length restriction on Windows
- Packages that depend on native modules now install more reliably
- Installing packages from behind proxy servers should work more easily now

### Windows

People on Windows have asked for more control over shell integrations. So we added a System panel to the Settings View on Windows for more control over Atom's integration with the operating system. Check it out ![:grinning:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f600.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":grinning:"}

### New UI inputs

A few commonly used inputs and other controls got added. Open the [Style Guide](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/creating-a-theme/#atom-styleguide) in Atom to see how you can use them in your package or further style in your theme.

### All the Little Things

For a comprehensive list, don't forget to check the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.10.0)! ![:memo:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":memo:"}

## 1.11 Beta

This version features performance and stability improvements and, in particular, we're excited that Atom now asks for permission before sending any telemetry data. ![:boom:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4a5.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":boom:"}

### Telemetry Permission

On launching 1.11 for the first time, all users will be presented with this screen asking for their assistance in improving Atom by allowing us to collect information while they use the application:

This is something that a lot of users have been asking for. We've always had ways to opt out but it is only right to make it obvious and clear. Now it is!

### Improvements and Bug Fixes

- Added a configuration option for the large file warning threshold
- Three improvements to the [image-view package](https://atom.io/packages/image-view) by first time code contributor [@Ben3eeE](https://github.com/ben3eee) ![:tada:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":tada:"}
  - Image View tabs that are in the pending state can now be confirmed by double-clicking the tabs
  - The status bar now shows the size in bytes of the image as well as the width and height
  - Fixed a bug where the dimensions of an image were reported as zero if more than one image was opened in the same action

- An option to show a [custom title bar](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11790) on macOS got added by [@brumm](https://github.com/brumm) ![:sparkles:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2728.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":sparkles:"}
- Fixed a regression in the environment patching on macOS for users of the zsh shell
- Made the Split Pane menu items work the way they used to
