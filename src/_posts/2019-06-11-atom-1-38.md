Atom 1.38 includes some improvements to the GitHub package and improvements to JS, ERB, Python, and JSON language support. Atom 1.39 beta includes a new `ripgrep`-based project search backend, an upgrade to Electron 3.1, and much improved loading times for multi-megabyte files containing only a single line of text.

### Github package improvements

- Now Atom [displays an "edited" label](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/2057) next to a pull request comment if it has been edited.
- User badges (like "First time contributor" or "Collaborator") [are shown](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/2085) next to the authors on PRs and review comments to encourage people to be kind to new folks.
- Resolved comments [are grouped together](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/2117) to make the pull request conversation easier to read.

### Improvements to JS, ERB, and Python language grammars

A few fixes have been added to the language parsers/syntax highlighter. Now Atom allows [folding the `default` label of `switch` statements in JS](https://github.com/atom/language-javascript/pull/644), it improves [the handling of comment characters in ERB](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/19279) and it fixes an issue when [folding `if` statements in Python](https://github.com/atom/language-python/pull/300).

### Tree-sitter parsing support for JSON

Syntax highlighting performance on JSON files is now substantially improved thanks to Atom now [using Tree-sitter to syntax highlight JSON files by default](https://github.com/atom/language-json/pull/68). Syntax-based folding and selection while editing JSON are another nice benefit of the switch to Tree-sitter.

## Atom 1.39 Beta

### Ripgrep based find and replace

Performing a project-wide search on a large repository [just got a lot faster](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/pull/1086) with a new search backend based on [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep). For now, ripgrep is an experimental option that can be toggled in the settings for the `find-and-replace` package.

Here are some results from our testing against repositories of various sizes. We're seeing searches run up to 22 times faster.

### Upgrade to Electron 3.1

[Atom now runs on Electron 3.1](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/19419), which advances our underlying browser implementation from Chrome 61 to Chrome 66 and gives packages access to new browser features, including [native support for async iterators and generators](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/12/nic63#iterators-generators).

### Improved performance loading large single-line files

In the past, loading multi-megabyte files containing a single line has caused performance problems for Atom. In 1.39, these kinds of files [now load about 75 times faster](https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/pull/312) than they did previously.

### Improved JSX support in TypeScript

JSX expressions in `.tsx` files are now supported by the [`ide-typescript`](https://github.com/atom/ide-typescript) package when Tree-sitter is enabled. In addition, you [can now provide type arguments](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-typescript/pull/68) in JSX expressions without confusing Atom's syntax highlighting.

### Community Contribution Highlights

We're thankful for the community contributors that help Atom get better on each release. These are some of them:

As usual, [@50wliu](https://github.com/50wliu) makes a strong showing with multiple pull requests. He helped us [fix apm installation issues on Linux](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/19370), [improved our approach to deserializing workspace items added by packages](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16100), and added the ability to [hold ctrl/cmd when dragging to copy items in the tree view](https://github.com/atom/tree-view/pull/1257). He also contributed a few other PRs that were less visible but equally important. See the release notes for details.

Long-time contributor [@Ben3eee](https://github.com/Ben3eee) continued his refinement of language support in Atom with [a PR to improve the styling of strings in the Tree-sitter C grammar](https://github.com/atom/language-c/pull/328) and [added support for Tree-sitter to our JSON language package](https://github.com/atom/language-json/pull/68).

Also on the Tree-sitter front, [@Caleb531](https://github.com/Caleb531) [improved the handling of `*args` and `**kwargs`](https://github.com/atom/language-python/pull/303) in our Python grammar.
