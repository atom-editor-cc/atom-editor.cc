Wow! In only a week and a half, the Atom community has really grown. Discussion [on the forum](https://discuss.atom.io/) is lively, and there's a real sense that everyone is happy to help  new people out. There's even ['a community-built, community-driven guide to hacking on the Atom editor'](https://github.com/jbranchaud/splitting-atoms) in the works. Your exploration and experimentation has also brought the total package count to over 500, and we're still in a closed beta! This is incredible. Here's a few of those 500+ packages that are interesting:

<!--more-->

## [vim-mode](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode)

This core package started out a product of the Atom team, but has rapidly become a great example of the community taking charge of a core package, with [lots of activity from a bunch of people](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pulse/monthly). The expectations for an editor's vim emulation are high, and with this kind of community support, things are looking good. Hat tip to [@zenhob](https://atom.io/users/zenhob), [@dougblack](https://atom.io/users/dougblack) and GitHub's own [@mcolyer](https://atom.io/users/mcolyer) for keeping on top of all the issues and PRs.

## [test-status](https://atom.io/packages/test-status)

Props to [@tombell](https://atom.io/users/tombell) for this package, which adds a success- or failure-colored Hubot icon to your status bar representing the repo's current test status, updated whenever you save.

## [color-picker](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker)

This package provides a color picker to atom that generates hex and RGB color codes from a familiar color pickin' interface. Great work, [@thomaslindstrom](https://atom.io/users/thomaslindstrom)!

## [atom-runner](https://atom.io/packages/atom-runner)

This package from [@lsegal](https://atom.io/users/lsegal) will run various script files inside of Atom. It currently supports JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Ruby, Python, and Go. You can add more.

Also check out [@rgbkrk](https://atom.io/users/rgbkrk)'s' [script](https://atom.io/packages/script) package for another take on the concept!

## [autocomplete-plus](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-plus)

The bundled autocomplete package shows completions when you hit a keybinding. Many folks prefer to have the completions always shown. There's some discussion about that on the [autocomplete repository](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete), but in the meantime this package from [@saschagehlich](https://atom.io/users/saschagehlich) provides that sort of behavior.

## [gist-it](https://atom.io/packages/gist-it)

I bet you can guess what this package from [@rpowelll](https://atom.io/users/rpowelll) does!

## Just the beginning

This is barely scratching the surface, there are so many great packages out there, and I've surely missed something incredible among all the activity. [What's your favorite package?](https://discuss.atom.io/t/whats-your-favorite-package/3996)
