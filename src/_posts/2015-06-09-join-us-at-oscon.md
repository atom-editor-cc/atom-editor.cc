The Atom team is [leading a workshop](http://www.oscon.com/open-source-2015/public/schedule/detail/44660) at this year's OSCON in Portland, Oregon! We'll cover the basics of developing new packages, and be available to answer questions about working on Atom core. The workshop is at 9AM on Monday, July 20, and if you're attending, we'd love to see youâ€”if you're not attending but would like to, early pricing ends on Thursday.
