The community is one of the best features of Atom, and we want to ensure it remains welcoming and safe for everyone. We have adopted the [Open Code of Conduct](http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/#Atom/opensource@github.com) for all projects in the [@atom GitHub organization](https://github.com/atom), the [discussion forum](https://discuss.atom.io/), and [chat rooms](http://atom-slack.herokuapp.com/). This code of conduct outlines the expectations for all community members, as well as steps to report unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored.
