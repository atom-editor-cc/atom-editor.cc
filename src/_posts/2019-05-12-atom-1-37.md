Atom 1.37 has shipped! This version introduces a complete flow for handling review comments you've received on a pull request and an experimental faster mode in fuzzy finder that dramatically improves its performance.

### Pull request review comments in the GitHub package

Responding to review comments that a reviewer has left on a pull request you've submitted can be cumbersome. You need to cross-reference lines back and forth between GitHub and your editor, using the diff context and line numbers to find the place where the comment was made.

Now, to reduce the amount of mental context switching you need to do, we show [reviews and review comments right in your favorite editor](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1995) ![:tada:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":tada:"} To open the all-new reviews tab, click on the "see reviews" button in the GitHub tab while you're on a branch associated with a pull request, or click "see reviews" in the footer of a pull request detail view.

![see reviews footer button](/assets/images/user-images.githubusercontent.com/17565/55828904-70e67580-5adb-11e9-8923-7df4178433ee.png)

With the reviews tab open, expand any review comment thread to read how awesome your code is. Click "Jump To File" to open or focus an editor and scroll to that line, or click "open diff" to scroll to the commented line on the diff in the pull request detail view. We'll automatically account for any changes you've made locally but haven't pushed yet.

While you're in an editor, any lines that have been commented on are highlighted. Click on the comment icon in the left gutter to jump back to that comment in the review tab.

Beneath the comment thread in the reviews tab, you can respond to the thread directly with the provided text box to keep the conversation going, or react with a reaction emoji. When you're satisfied that you've addressed the feedback from a specific comment thread, click "Resolve conversation" to mark the thread as resolved. To help you keep track of your progress through review feedback, resolved comment threads will be greyed out and counted in a progress bar at the top of the tab.

Get the bar green, get those green checks, and get your code shipped! ![:rocket:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f680.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":rocket:"} ![:rocket:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f680.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":rocket:"} ![:rocket:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f680.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":rocket:"}

### Dramatic fuzzy-finder performance boost

The fuzzy finder's project crawling performance has been [improved dramatically](https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder/pull/369) by switching to a [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)-powered backend.

Similarly, the filtering performance has been drastically improved. This means that results will show much faster while typing on the fuzzy finder.

These two improvements are most noticeable in projects with large numbers of files - for example, we measured a **14x** speed boost in the crawling performance on a project with 270K files.

Since these changes cause some slightly different results, we've placed them behind a configuration option for now while we work out any unexpected kinks in the transition. When you open a project with a large amount of files you'll see a prompt to enable it:

![fuzzy finder prompt](/assets/images/user-images.githubusercontent.com/408035/57457179-54229680-726f-11e9-8102-f4cb26ab9694.png)

### Authenticate and encrypt communications over Atom's activation socket

While it's launching, Atom uses a UNIX domain socket (on macOS and Linux) or a named pipe (on Windows) to determine if an existing main process is hanging around to open a window for you before starting a new one. Now, all communication that occurs through that channel is [authenticated and encrypted](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/19109) to keep other people with access to your machine from reading or interfering with those messages.

As a related change, [the `--socket-path` command-line argument has been removed](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/19103), although it doesn't look like it was used outside of internal testing.

### Language package improvements

The bundled language packages have another set of goodies in the pipeline in beta as well:

- `language-clojure` can [handle non-ASCII characters](https://github.com/atom/language-clojure/pull/82) in keywords, symbols, and identifiers, like the clojure compiler itself, thanks to [@PEZ](https://github.com/PEZ).
- [@caleb531](https://github.com/caleb531) made the `language-python` tree-sitter grammar able to recognize [shebang lines that reference "python2" or "python3"](https://github.com/atom/language-python/pull/296) instead of just "python".
- `language-toml` now correctly tokenizes multiple key/value pairs on a single line, again thanks to [@caleb531](https://github.com/caleb531) ![:smile:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":smile:"}

- Finally, `language-ruby` [recognizes "next" as a keyword](https://github.com/atom/language-ruby/pull/262) thanks to [@willcosgrove](https://github.com/willcosgrove).

## Atom 1.38 Beta

Atom 1.38 beta includes some improvements on the GitHub package and a few fixes on the language parsers.

### Github package improvements

- Now Atom [displays an "edited" label](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/2057) next to a pull request comment if it has been edited.
- User badges (like "First time contributor" or "Collaborator") [are shown](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/2085) next to the authors on PRs and review comments to encourage people to be kind to new folks.
- Resolved comments [are grouped together](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/2117) to make the pull request conversation easier to read.

### Fixes when handling some languages

A few fixes have been added to the language parsers/syntax highlighter. Now Atom allows [folding the `default` label in `switch` statements](https://github.com/atom/language-javascript/pull/644), it improves [the handling of comment characters in ERB](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/19279) and it fixes an issue when [folding `if` statements in Python](https://github.com/atom/language-python/pull/300).

### Community Contribution Highlights

We're thankful for the community contributors that help Atom get better on each release. These are some of them:
- Thanks [@50Wliu](https://github.com/50Wliu) for adding [a way to move conflicting entries](https://github.com/atom/tree-view/pull/1180), this is a really nice improvement to the Tree View!
- Props to [@brainsnail](https://github.com/brainsnail) for [adding support for Go module and checksum files](https://github.com/atom/language-go/pull/156) in our language parser, now people can use new Go features in Atom and get proper highlighting.

<!-- end of beta changes -->

There are many more details in the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.38.0-beta0).
