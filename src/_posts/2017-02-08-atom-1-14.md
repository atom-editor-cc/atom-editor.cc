[Atom 1.14](/) has shipped today with improved large file performance, a 64-bit Windows installation, improved MRU tab traversal, and more.

<!--more-->

### Large file performance

A fundamental component of the text editor called the display layer [has been redesigned](https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/pull/185) to rely on a new data structure that is implemented in C++. These changes enable Atom to open larger files more quickly while using much less memory. Improvements in this area are ongoing, so expect more in upcoming releases.

### 64-bit Windows installation

Atom 1.14 makes available a [64-bit installation](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13135) for Windows! ![:tada:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":tada:"}

### MRU tab traversal

There was some—lets call it _pointed_—feedback about our initial implementation of most-recently-used tab traversal that we've addressed in this release:

- An MRU-ordered list of the tabs to visit now appears during MRU traversal.
- There is an option in the tabs package settings to make ctrl-tab and ctrl-shift-tab do MRU or simple left/right traversal.
- Fixed a bug in keyup handling such that the MRU order doesn't appear to randomly change.

- [Overhaul of the bundled C# grammar](https://github.com/atom/language-csharp/pull/87)
- [Upgrade find-and-replace to use new marker layer API for fast clearing of markers](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13516)
- [Option for avoiding overlay movements](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11852)
- [Reduce the impact of leaking Editor, Selection, & Cursor objects](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13523)

Don't forget to check out all the other improvements shipping with this version in the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.14.0)! ![:memo:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":memo:"}

## Atom 1.15 Beta

![Release Beta](/assets/images/blog.atom.io/img/release-beta.png)
This is a quiet month because most of the team is toiling away on cool stuff that's not yet shipping. But we do have a few goodies hitting Beta!

### Duplicate selections with multiple lines

The behavior when duplicating lines when there are multiple selections is now more intuitive.

### Tabs of deleted files are retained

By [popular demand](https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/306) Atom will now keep open the tab of any file, modified or not, when it's deleted outside the editor. You can turn off this behavior with a new core setting:

### Cursors are always visible by default

Atom has always done the MacOS thing and not shown a blinking cursor at the end of a text selection. That's atypical for a text editor aimed at developers so it's now [turned on by default and configurable](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13664).

### Other updates

- Apm now [honors system HTTP proxy settings](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/pull/898).
- Removals from the Jump List on Windows are [now handled correctly](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13685).
- [Node 6 is now required to _build_ Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13696/files).

There are many more details in the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.15.0-beta0).
