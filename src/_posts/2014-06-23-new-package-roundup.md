It's been a while since our [last package roundup](/blog/2014/03/10/new-package-roundup). In the meantime, the number of [packages](/packages) has grown to over 850, so we wanted to share a few more packages we found interesting and useful.

If you've created or used some great packages, we'd love to hear about them! Let us know ![:mega:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4e3.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":mega:"} on [the forum](https://discuss.atom.io/t/whats-your-favorite-package/3996) or ping ![:bell:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f514.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":bell:"} [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/atomeditor).

## [bezier-curve-editor](/packages/bezier-curve-editor)

First up, [@abe33](https://github.com/abe33) brings us this amazing ![:sparkles:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2728.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":sparkles:"} package for all our CSS Bezier curve editing needs.

## [file-icons](/packages/file-icons) and [filetype-color](/packages/filetype-color)

If you wanted to make the Tree View more ![:lipstick:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f484.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":lipstick:"}, then the file-icons package (by [@danbrooker](https://github.com/danbrooker)) and the filetype-color package (by [@sommerper](https://github.com/sommerper)) are just the right things for you!

These two packages make it super-easy to set icons and colors for files and folders shown in the tree view, "for improved visual grepping".

## [regex-railroad-diagram](/packages/regex-railroad-diagram)

Getting trolled by regular expressions is one of the perks of writing software. This package enhances the experience by showing you a railroad diagram of the regex under your cursor. Even though [@klorenz](https://github.com/klorenz) mentions that this package is still under development, we couldn't not mention it. ![:zap:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/26a1.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":zap:"}

## [editor-settings](/packages/editor-settings)

This package by [@nirix](https://github.com/nirix) adds support for per-language and per-file extension editor settings. Not all settings are supported, but more than enough to be useful. Also, [@nirix](https://github.com/nirix) already has plans to provide support for per-directory editor settings.

There's a [feature request](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2593) to provide this ability in Atom core, but in the meantime - this package is a great way to get that. Also, check out [editorconfig](/packages/editorconfig), a similar package by [@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus), and [this approach](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2593#issuecomment-45977234) by [@lee-dohm](https://github.com/lee-dohm) who uses the [init.coffee](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/the-init-file/) script to achieve something similar.

## [resize-panes](/packages/resize-panes)

Resizing panes is another [feature request](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/274) on Atom core. Until that's implemented, you might want to try this neat package by [@santip](https://github.com/santip).

The same author brings us two other packages for working with panes: [move-panes](/packages/move-panes) for moving the active tab to another pane, and [maximize-panes](/packages/maximize-panes) for maximizing the active pane.

## [atom-color-highlight](/packages/atom-color-highlight)

If you use the [color-picker](/packages/color-picker), then you'll enjoy this packages as well. Thanks again [@abe33](https://github.com/abe33)!
