Atom 1.36 has shipped! Upgrade today to open single files in large directories much faster, see pull request review comments from GitHub, specify multiple wrap guides at once, and more.

<!--more-->

### Open a single file without its parent directory

Have you ever wanted to make a quick edit to a single file in your home directory, only to have Atom dutifully process and index _all_ of your files?

When a root directory is added to your open project, we do a bunch of work to understand its contents, watching for relevant filesystem changes and populating the tree view. Previously, when you opened Atom on a single file, we automatically added its containing directory as a root directory. This was good for restoring persisted session state, but had the unfortunate consequence of slowing things to a crawl when that directory was a large one. Now we [only open the file you've asked us to](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/18608), which we can do much more quickly.

Happy dotfile editing! ![:sparkles:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2728.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":sparkles:"}

### Fuzzy Finder Performance

Once upon a time, there was a noticeable lag between when you opened Atom with a large repository and when you could use the fuzzy finder to actually open files. Thanks to some smart detective work, fuzzy finder performance is now much improved! This release [shaves a whopping 40%](https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder/pull/366) off the time it takes to index files in medium and large repositories.

### Pull request review comments and large diff detection in the GitHub package

The GitHub package allows you to [read review comments left on pull requests](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1856) without leaving the comfort of your editor. Open the "files changed" tab of a pull request detail view to check it out.

We've been researching and iterating and refining on this one heavily in the past few months. Peek ahead at the [beta release notes](#atom-137-beta) below to see where we've taken the review experience next ![:eyes:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f440.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":eyes:"}

![pull requests comments](/assets/images/user-images.githubusercontent.com/378023/52465966-f32de880-2bc3-11e9-8de5-2d93dd42920c.png)

You can also [collapse and expand](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1913) any files within diff views that show diffs from multiple files, such as commit preview and the pull request files view. Large files are collapsed by default, because you probably don't need to see those 800 lines of `package-lock.json` changes in such great detail. (And if you do, just expand them!)

Keyboard shortcuts for finding text [now work within the diff view](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1922). That'll make it easier to remove all those forgotten `console.log()` statements you were about to commit.

![find text](/assets/images/user-images.githubusercontent.com/378023/52465967-f3c67f00-2bc3-11e9-80d7-336c77c27b12.gif)

On a related note, if you write a package that embeds a `TextEditor` within a custom workspace item, you too can wire it up to integrate with find-and-replace by implementing the [`getEmbeddedTextEditor()`](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/pull/1068) or [`observeEmbeddedTextEditors()`](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/pull/1069) methods on your item.

### Auto-updater improvements for Windows and macOS

We've taken care of some rough edges that had accumulated in our auto-updater logic. On Windows, if the `core.automaticallyUpdate` setting was set to `false`, Atom would incorrectly tell you that you couldn't _manually_ upgrade from the "About" pane. Meanwhile, on macOS, clicking "restart and install update" would close Atom but not properly re-launch as the new version. Both of these have been fixed.

### Multiple wrap guides

Hat tip to [@lexicalunit](https://github.com/lexicalunit) for this one: you may now configure [multiple wrap guide columns](https://github.com/atom/wrap-guide/pull/56). This can be useful if you want to give yourself a "soft limit" to let yourself know you should be wrapping up that line soon.

To turn it on, edit your `config.cson` file to include the array of guide columns:

```coffee
'wrap-guide':
  'columns': [72, 80, 100, 120]
```

### Language package improvements

We have a host of improvements to bundled language packages in this release:

- [@cuberoot](https://github.com/cuberoot) added [JSX support](https://github.com/atom/language-coffee-script/pull/172) to `language-coffeescript`.
- Thanks to [@Ingramz](https://github.com/Ingramz), `language-html` will [correctly use the "GraphQL" grammar for embedded GraphQL](https://github.com/atom/language-html/pull/221) in script tags. Note that you'll need to install the [community GraphQL package](/packages/language-graphql) to syntax-highlight properly.
- `language-javascript` now understands tagged template strings that accept arguments, like those from [the Styled Components library](https://www.styled-components.com/). [@bennypowers](https://github.com/bennypowers) also taught it to understand `css`, `graphql`, and `sql` sub-grammars within template literals that use the appropriate tags.
- Finally, the tree-sitter grammar on `language-ruby` has improved the way it highlights certain float and integer literals.

### Isolated Atom environment for Jasmine tests

Package authors take note! Previously, if your package used the [default Jasmine test runner](https://flight-manual.atom-editor.cc/hacking-atom/sections/writing-specs/), the Atom environment used by your tests would activate any packages that you happened to have installed locally. This could cause your tests to unexpectedly fail if there were any problems with your other packages, or, worse, to silently depend on something that was changed by a different package. We now [further isolate the Atom environment](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/18801) to keep things nice and reproducible.

If your tests _do_ depend on another package being activated, set the `APM_TEST_PACKAGES` environment variable to a space-separated list of package names and they will be available to your tests. Conveniently, this is the same way that [atom/ci](https://github.com/atom/ci#how-do-i-install-other-atom-packages-that-my-package-build-depends-on) allows you to specify package dependencies.

### And more

Don't forget to check out all the other improvements shipping with Atom 1.36 in the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.36.0)! ![:memo:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":memo:"}

## Atom 1.37 Beta

Atom 1.37 beta introduces a complete flow for handling review comments you've received on a pull request.

![In-editor pull request review comments](/assets/images/user-images.githubusercontent.com/6842965/55832018-8a3ef000-5ae2-11e9-9256-54199f38082a.png)

### Pull request review comments in the GitHub package

Responding to review comments that a reviewer has left on a pull request you've submitted can be cumbersome. You need to cross-reference lines back and forth between GitHub and your editor, using the diff context and line numbers to find the place where the comment was made.

Now, to reduce the amount of mental context switching you need to do, we show [reviews and review comments right in your favorite editor](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1995) ![:tada:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":tada:"} To open the all-new reviews tab, click on the "see reviews" button in the GitHub tab while you're on a branch associated with a pull request, or click "see reviews" in the footer of a pull request detail view.

![see reviews footer button](/assets/images/user-images.githubusercontent.com/17565/55828904-70e67580-5adb-11e9-8923-7df4178433ee.png)

With the reviews tab open, expand any review comment thread to read how awesome your code is. Click "Jump To File" to open or focus an editor and scroll to that line, or click "open diff" to scroll to the commented line on the diff in the pull request detail view. We'll automatically account for any changes you've made locally but haven't pushed yet.

While you're in an editor, any lines that have been commented on are highlighted. Click on the comment icon in the left gutter to jump back to that comment in the review tab.

![jump to file](/assets/images/user-images.githubusercontent.com/17565/55828621-d25a1480-5ada-11e9-9994-e84c5674b2ec.png)

Beneath the comment thread in the reviews tab, you can respond to the thread directly with the provided text box to keep the conversation going, or react with a reaction emoji. When you're satisfied that you've addressed the feedback from a specific comment thread, click "Resolve conversation" to mark the thread as resolved. To help you keep track of your progress through review feedback, resolved comment threads will be greyed out and counted in a progress bar at the top of the tab.

![reply and resolve](/assets/images/user-images.githubusercontent.com/7910250/55824306-77afc100-5ab8-11e9-8d5b-d5d7a7f50282.gif)

Get the bar green, get those green checks, and get your code shipped! ![:rocket:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f680.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":rocket:"} ![:rocket:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f680.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":rocket:"} ![:rocket:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f680.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":rocket:"}

### Dramatic fuzzy-finder performance boost

The fuzzy finder's project crawling performance has been [improved dramatically](https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder/pull/369) by switching to a [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)-powered backend. This is most noticeable in projects with large numbers of files - for example, we measured a **14x** speed boost in a project with 270K files.

The ripgrep-powered search returns somewhat different results, so we've placed it behind a configuration option for now while we work out any unexpected kinks in the transition. To turn it on, open the fuzzy-finder package settings in your Settings view and enable the "Use Rip Grep" option.

![ripgrep option](/assets/images/user-images.githubusercontent.com/17565/55829735-63ca8600-5add-11e9-98e9-b52d3caf471f.png)

### Authenticate and encrypt communications over Atom's activation socket

While it's launching, Atom uses a UNIX domain socket (on macOS and Linux) or a named pipe (on Windows) to determine if an existing main process is hanging around to open a window for you before starting a new one. Now, all communication that occurs through that channel is [authenticated and encrypted](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/19109) to keep other people with access to your machine from reading or interfering with those messages.

As a related change, [the `--socket-path` command-line argument has been removed](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/19103), although it doesn't look like it was used outside of internal testing.

### Language package improvements

The bundled language packages have another set of goodies in the pipeline in beta as well:

- `language-clojure` can [handle non-ASCII characters](https://github.com/atom/language-clojure/pull/82) in keywords, symbols, and identifiers, like the clojure compiler itself, thanks to [@PEZ](https://github.com/PEZ).
- [@caleb531](https://github.com/caleb531) made the `language-python` tree-sitter grammar able to recognize [shebang lines that reference "python2" or "python3"](https://github.com/atom/language-python/pull/296) instead of just "python".
- `language-toml` now correctly tokenizes multiple key/value pairs on a single line, again thanks to [@caleb531](https://github.com/caleb531) ![:smile:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":smile:"}

- Finally, `language-ruby` [recognizes "next" as a keyword](https://github.com/atom/language-ruby/pull/262) thanks to [@willcosgrove](https://github.com/willcosgrove).

<!-- end of beta changes -->
