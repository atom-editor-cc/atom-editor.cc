## Atom 1.8.0

Below is a summary of some noteworthy changes that shipped with Atom 1.8.0. Thank you very much to all of our beta users who have tested and provided useful feedback during the beta period! ![:tada:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":tada:"}

### Better Environment Handling

When launching Atom from your terminal, the existing windows' environments will now be updated with the most recent environment variables. Props to [@joefitzgerald](https://github.com/joefitzgerald) for implementing this! ![:clap:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44f.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":clap:"}

### Move Selected Text Left and Right

This version ships with two new commands for moving text left and right by one column. By default, they are bound to `cmd-ctrl-left` and `cmd-ctrl-right` on OS X and `alt-shift-left` and `alt-shift-right` on Windows and Linux. Shoutout to [@mnquintana](https://github.com/mnquintana) for this new feature! ![:zap:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/26a1.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":zap:"}

### Introduce `core.restorePreviousWindowsOnStart`

The default behavior of the `atom` command is to bring back all the windows that were opened when Atom was last closed. We understand, however, that everyone has different development preferences and, as such, we have introduced the `core.restorePreviousWindowsOnStart` setting. This option will be on by default, but you can easily turn it off by changing your `config.cson` file (please note that this setting won't appear in the Settings UI).

Props to our awesome community, and in particular to [@jordanbtucker](https://github.com/jordanbtucker), for the great work on this! ![:rocket:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f680.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":rocket:"}

### Other Improvements and Bugfixes

We have worked on shipping several bug fixes for this release, including [bad emoji rendering on OS X](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11325), [accidental UI zooming](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11345), [inaccurate block decoration measurements](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11240) and a number of [Git](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11214) related [issues](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11315). Together, they should deliver an even smoother and robust editing experience.

To see every PR that went into this release, please check out its [changelog](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.8.0).

## Atom 1.9.0-beta0

This beta version of Atom introduces several important changes that will bring performance and reliability improvements to the editor, as well as some new features we are really excited about. We recommend you check it out! ![:sparkles:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2728.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":sparkles:"}

### Internals Redesign - Display Layers

We have been working on a complete restructure of the editor display layer. We plan to share all the details of this redesign in the future in a more in-depth blog post, but in the meantime here are some of the things that have been improved as part of this rewrite:

1. Faster editing and scrolling when soft-wrap is enabled or some text regions are folded.
2. Introduction of free-form folds, in addition to row-based folds, via `Fold Selection` (`alt-cmd-ctrl-f` on OS X and `alt-ctrl-f` on Windows and Linux).
3. Improved strategy when soft-wraps occur at whitespace locations.

### Electron Upgrade (v0.37.8)

This upgrade features many rendering and performance improvements and, in particular, we are very excited about `optimizeLegibility` being turned on by default, which is going to enable efficient ligatures rendering on all the platforms. Shoutout to [@50Wliu](https://github.com/50Wliu) for the great work on this! ![:sparkles:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2728.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":sparkles:"}

### Drag and Drop Layout Management

Thanks to [@MikeInnes](https://github.com/MikeInnes), we are very proud to announce drag and drop layout management for tabs. We think this is a great feature that will make organizing your workspace even easier! ![:tada:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":tada:"}

### Cygwin and Msys Compatibility On Windows

As part of our ongoing effort on improving Atom on Windows, we have released a fix that will make the `atom` command compatible with both Cygwin and Msys, providing a more consistent experience across all the platforms.

- [atom/atom#11762 - Ensure atom command works on Cygwin + MSYS bash shells](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11762)
- [atom/atom#11833 - Ensure Cygwin + Msys compatibility on Windows](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11833)

### Enhanced Reliability When Saving Files

With this release, we are shipping a File Recovery Service running on the main process, which takes advantage of the Electron process model to recover truncated file data in the case of a hard crash in the renderer process. By default, this service tries to recover files automatically: if during that process there is a power outage, or something else causes your computer to shutdown, a backup will be saved under `~/.atom/recovery`.

- [atom/atom#11828 - File Recovery Service](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11828)

We can't wait to hear your feedback about these changes! For a more comprehensive list of improvements and bug fixes, please check out the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.9.0-beta0).
