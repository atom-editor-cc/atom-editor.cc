[Atom 1.11](/) features performance and stability improvements and, in particular, we're excited that Atom now asks for permission before sending any telemetry data. ![:boom:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4a5.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":boom:"}

### Telemetry Permission

On launching 1.11 for the first time, all users will be presented with this screen asking for their assistance in improving Atom by allowing us to collect information while they use the application:

This is something that a lot of users have been asking for. We've always had ways to opt out but it is only right to make it obvious and clear. Now it is!

### Image View improvements

Three improvements to the [image-view package](/packages/image-view) by first time code contributor [@Ben3eeE](https://github.com/ben3eee) ![:tada:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":tada:"}

- Image View tabs that are in the pending state can now be confirmed by double-clicking the tabs
- The status bar now shows the size in bytes of the image as well as the width and height
- Fixed a bug where the dimensions of an image were reported as zero if more than one image was opened in the same action

### Custom Title Bar

An option to show a [custom title bar](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11790) on macOS got added by [@brumm](https://github.com/brumm). ![:sparkles:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2728.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":sparkles:"} It will adapt to the theme colors and be less jarring when a dark theme is used. To try it out, go to `Settings > Core` and enable "Use Custom Title Bar".

### Improvements and Bug Fixes

- Added a configuration option for the large file warning threshold
- Fixed a regression in the environment patching on macOS for users of the zsh shell
- Made the Split Pane menu items work the way they used to

Don't forget to check out all the other improvements shipping with this version in the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.11.0)! ![:memo:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":memo:"}

## Atom 1.12 Beta

![Release Beta](/assets/images/blog.atom.io/img/release-beta.png)

### International Keyboard Support

New APIs available in Chrome 52 allowed us to take on this [long-requested feature](https://github.com/atom/atom-keymap/issues/35). The new APIs turned out to be less important than we originally thought but we're nonetheless happy to report Atom users in all locales now get typical keyboard behavior in Atom's default installation.

### Electron 1.3

Thanks to some amazing work by community maintainer [@thomasjo](https://github.com/thomasjo), Atom comes out of the Electron dark ages in this release with an update to 1.3.6, bringing Chrome 52 along for the ride.

### Keybinding Usability

The scope specificity rules for keybindings were understandably confusing lots of Atom users. This release has a [major simplification](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12760) such that user-defined keybindings take precedence.

### Windows Fixes

There are a number of tweaks specific to Atom on Windows, including:

- [Shell Integration upgrade reliability](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12642)
- [Allow multiple instances on Windows](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9459)
- [Move emacs editor bindings to Darwin to avoid Windows menu conflicts](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12892)

As ever, you can find all the gory details in the full [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.12.0-beta0).
