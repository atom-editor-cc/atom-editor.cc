![:star:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2b50.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":star:"} We've added stars to Atom.io. ![:star:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2b50.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":star:"}

Stars are a new way to keep track of packages you find interesting. You can see the packages you've starred on your user page, and also explore what other users have starred.

Stars are supported by `apm` as well. You can list your stars, and star and unstar packages - check out `apm help stars` for the full docs.

Stars can also be used to set up a new install of Atom with your favorite packages - just run `apm stars --install`, and everything you've starred will be installed. You can also try out _other_  users' Atom setups by installing _their_ stars:

```
apm stars --user thedaniel --install
