## Atom 1.19 Beta

![Atom Beta](/assets/images/blog.atom.io/img/release-beta.png)

Atom 1.19 includes two major architectural updates and an update to Electron 1.6.9.

### Native Text Buffer

Atom 1.19 introduces an implementation of [Atom's underlying text buffer in native C++](https://github.com/atom/superstring). File saves are now asynchronous and will never block the UI. Memory usage for large files has been reduced.

### Editor Rendering Layer Rewrite

This release includes a [full rewrite](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13880) of the text editor's rendering layer. We revisited all of our DOM layout and script interactions with the goal of improving performance, reducing complexity, and taking advantage of new APIs such as [intersection observers](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/04/intersectionobserver), [resize observers](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/10/resizeobserver), and [CSS containment boundaries](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/06/css-containment). Look for an in-depth post next week for more details.

### Other Notable Changes and Fixes

- [Render line number gutter without numbers when showLineNumbers is false](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14694)
- [Improved clarity of Editor not responding actions](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14753)
- [Restore ability for `escape` to return focus to center](https://github.com/atom/tree-view/pull/1127)
- [Optimize trailing whitespace removal using native buffer search](https://github.com/atom/whitespace/pull/157)

There are many more details in the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.19.0-beta0).
