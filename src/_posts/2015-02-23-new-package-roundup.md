It's been too long [since our last package roundup post](/blog/2014/09/17/new-package-roundup), so we wanted to share a few neat packages the community developed. If you notice any new and interesting packages, [let us know](https://twitter.com/atomeditor)!

# [AtomPair](/packages/atom-pair)

The [@pusher](https://github.com/pusher) team created an amazing package for remote pair programming with features for text synchronization, file-sharing, HipChat invitations, synchronized syntax highlighting, and collaborator visibility. Check out [their blog post](https://blog.pusher.com/atom-pair/) for more information.

# [Symbols Tree View](/packages/symbols-tree-view)

Similar to the taglist and tagbar plugins for VIM, this package from [@xndcn](https://github.com/xndcn) organizes symbols in a tree view and scrolls to the destination when you click a symbol. Great work!

# [Block cursor](/packages/block-cursor)

[@olmokramer](https://github.com/olmokramer) brings us a package for customizing the cursor in a number of ways, including cursor type, secondary color and pulse duration.

# [Project Palette Finder](/packages/project-palette-finder)

Another useful tool from one of the most productive package authors, [@abe33](https://github.com/abe33), this package finds and exposes colors defined in a project's CSS, Less, Sass or Stylus files.

# [Git Control](/packages/git-control)

[@jacogr](https://github.com/jacogr) created a graphical interface to manage commonly-used Git commands (for example, switching branches, selecting files for commits, merging, and resetting files). The author says that this is a first-release and there are some issues remaining, but it's definitely worth checking out.

# [Redacted](/packages/redacted)

As [@ymendel](https://github.com/ymendel) puts it, this package is: "████ plugin ████████ █████████ redaction █████████████ for Atom, ███ ████████ text ██████ ███ ███ ████ ███████." A true gem!
