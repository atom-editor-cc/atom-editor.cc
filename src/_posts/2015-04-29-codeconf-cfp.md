[CodeConf](http://codeconf.com/) is returning June 25 & 26 in Nashville to feature the best that the open source community has to offer. The [call for proposals](http://codeconf.com/cfp.html) is now open and we want to hear from the Atom community.

### Featuring Atom at CodeConf

CodeConf will feature dedicated sessions on Atom and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) from the core team, but we'd love to hear from the community, too. We're looking for a wide range of sessionsâ€”technical deep-dives, documentation, best practices, or developing the Atom community, for example. Whether you're a power user, a package maintainer, or a contributor, we encourage you to submit a proposal to speak at CodeConf.

### Open to everyone

CodeConf is dedicated to highlighting new voices from the open source community. Whether you plan to give your first talk or your fiftieth talk, we're actively seeking a diverse line-up of speakers from all disciplines.

If you're chosen as a speaker, we'll cover your travel and accommodation expenses. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the conference [code of conduct](http://codeconf.com/codeofconduct.html) before submitting a session. Full details about the submission process can be found in the [call for proposals](http://codeconf.com/cfp.html).

### Don't delay

The call for proposals **closes May 10 at 11:59pm PDT**, so [submit your proposals](http://codeconf.com/cfp.html) before it's too late.

Come with an open mind, and leave a better contributor.
