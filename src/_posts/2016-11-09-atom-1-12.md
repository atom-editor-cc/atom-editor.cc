[Atom 1.12](/) has shipped today with another helping of fixes and improvements.

<!--more-->

### International Keyboard Support

New APIs available in Chrome 52 allowed us to take on this [long-requested feature](https://github.com/atom/atom-keymap/issues/35). The new APIs turned out to be less important than we originally thought but we're nonetheless happy to report Atom users in all locales now get typical keyboard behavior in Atom's default installation.

### Electron 1.3

Thanks to some amazing work by community maintainer [@thomasjo](https://github.com/thomasjo), Atom comes out of the Electron dark ages in this release with an update to 1.3.6, bringing Chrome 52 along for the ride.

### Keybinding Usability

The scope specificity rules for keybindings were understandably confusing lots of Atom users. This release has a [major simplification](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12760) such that user-defined keybindings take precedence.

### Windows Fixes

There are a number of tweaks specific to Atom on Windows, including:

- [Shell Integration upgrade reliability](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12642)
- [Allow multiple instances on Windows](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9459)
- [Move emacs editor bindings to Darwin to avoid Windows menu conflicts](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12892)

Don't forget to check out all the other improvements shipping with this version in the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.12.0)! ![:memo:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":memo:"}

### Atom Benchmarks

In our continuous mission to improve Atom's performance, 1.13 introduces [benchmarks](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12984) to better quantify improvements or ![:scream:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f631.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":scream:"} regressions.

### Shadow DOM Removal

This release marks [the end of Atom's failed experiment](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12903) using the Shadow DOM as a way to isolate the editor from unintended CSS. We'll have an in-depth post about this soon.

### New Octicons

A new version of the Octicons is now bundled in Atom with improvements to line-weight and sizing normalization. In addition [20 new icons](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13138) are available. ![:tada:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":tada:"}

### Keystroke Resolver API

To help address the long tail of unusual international keyboard behaviors as interpreted by Chrome, particularly on Linux, Atom 1.13 includes a [custom keystroke resolver API](https://github.com/atom/atom-keymap/pull/164) allowing users to assign Chrome keyboard events to Atom-style keystrokes.

### Usability Improvements

- [Recent Project menu and API](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13046)
- [Allow reordering project folders via drag and drop](https://github.com/atom/tree-view/pull/525)
- [Optional full-width status bar](https://github.com/atom/status-bar/pull/152)
- [Follow-through tooltip behavior](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13095)
- [Don't show find panel when doing cmd-e](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/pull/796)

### Performance Boosters

- [Don't construct placeholder tokenized lines](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12933)
- [Avoid forcing computation of all screen lines when opening a file](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12898)
