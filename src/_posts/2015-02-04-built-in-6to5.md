## Update

Since this post was originally published the 6to5 library was renamed to babel so packages should now use the `"use babel";` pragma in their JavaScript files.

See [atom/atom#5579](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5579) for more details.

## Original Post

Starting with yesterday's [0.177 release](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v0.177.0), Atom now has built-in support for preprocessing JavaScript files using the [6to5](http://6to5.org/) library.

This allows you to use new ECMAScript 6 features in your packages that aren't yet implemented in the versions of [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/Home) and [io.js](https://iojs.org/) that ship with Atom.

To use this in your packages, make `"use 6to5";` the very first line of any `.js` files you'd like to transform using 6to5. So, for example, here is a package's `main.js` file that uses the new ES6 [arrow functions](http://6to5.org/docs/learn-es6/#arrows):

```js
"use 6to5";

exports.activate   = () => console.log('this package was activated')
exports.deactivate = () => console.log('this package was deactivated')
```

Since arrow functions aren't natively supported yet, the code will be converted on-the-fly to:

```js
exports.activate = function () {
  return console.log("this package was activated");
};
exports.deactivate = function () {
  return console.log("this package was deactivated");
};
```

The 6to5 support uses the same caching strategy that is used for CoffeeScript, CSON, and Less files, so using it in your packages shouldn't negatively impact startup time.

A huge thanks goes out to [Michael Bolin](https://github.com/bolinfest) from Facebook, who added this feature. You can check out [pull request #5299](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5299) for the discussion and implementation details.

Check out the [Learn ES6](http://6to5.org/docs/learn-es6) article on [6to5.org](http://6to5.org/) for more information about all the great new ES6 features.
