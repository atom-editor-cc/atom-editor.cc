It was a quiet month because most of the team is toiling away on cool stuff that's not yet shipping. But we do have a few goodies hitting [Atom 1.15](/).

### Duplicate selections with multiple lines

The behavior when duplicating lines when there are multiple selections is now more intuitive.

### Tabs of deleted files are retained

By [popular demand](https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/306) Atom will now keep open the tab of any file, modified or not, when it's deleted outside the editor. You can turn off this behavior with a new core setting:

### Cursors are always visible by default

Atom has always done the MacOS thing and not shown a blinking cursor at the end of a text selection. That's atypical for a text editor aimed at developers so it's now [turned on by default and configurable](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13664).

### Fix for hangs on opening minified files

A change was added to Atom that [improves our handling of minified files](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13820) so that it should no longer hang when accidentally (or on purpose) clicking on that minified JavaScript or CSS file you have in your project ![:grinning:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f600.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":grinning:"} See the PR linked above for details on how we did this and some great benchmark numbers!

### Other updates

- Apm now [honors system HTTP proxy settings](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/pull/898).
- Removals from the Jump List on Windows are [now handled correctly](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13685).
- [Node 6 is now required to _build_ Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13696/files).

Don't forget to check out all the other improvements shipping with this version in the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.15.0)! ![:memo:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":memo:"}

## Atom 1.16 Beta

### More title bar options (macOS)

On macOS you can now choose between two more title bar options (`Settings > Core Settings > Title Bar`).

Option 1: `custom-inset` adds a bit more padding around the "traffic lights". This might not seem that useful on first glance, but the "traffic lights" will look more aligned when combined with something that needs more height. For example when the title bar gets replaced with a tool bar.

![custom-inset title bar](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/21953493/4a8b4b36-da7c-11e6-9938-7ffc62e8e495.png)

Option 2: `hidden` completely removes the title bar for people that like things minimalistic or want to save an extra 22 pixels. To drag the window the status bar can be used.

Note that by enabling these options some functionality will be lost. Especially when the title bar is hidden managing the window needs to be done with keybard shortcuts or using the menu.

### Stepping closer to removing jQuery from Atom

A number of packages have had their use of jQuery reduced or removed. This is part of our ongoing effort to remove this weighty dependency from Atom. These are some of the most recent changes:

- [Replaced atom-space-pen-views with etch and, where appropriate, also manual DOM manipulation](https://github.com/atom/snippets/pull/233)
- [Using atom-select-list as a drop-in replacement for atom-space-pen-views](https://github.com/atom/spell-check/pull/193)
- [Removed atom-space-pen-views](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/pull/913)
- [Overhauled package and remove atom-space-pen-views](https://github.com/atom/timecop/pull/23)
- [Replaced atom-space-pen-views with etch](https://github.com/atom/image-view/pull/82)
- [Overhauled ArchiveView and remove atom-space-pen-views](https://github.com/atom/archive-view/pull/45)

There are many more details in the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.16.0-beta0).
