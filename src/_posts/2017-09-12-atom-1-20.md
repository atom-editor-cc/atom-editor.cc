Atom 1.20 is available on the stable channel today and features numerous improvements in the `github`, `find-and-replace`, and `language-php` packages.

### Git Integration Improvements

The way diff views get opened [was reworked](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1016) resulting in pending pane support and multiple simultaneous diff views:

We've also enabled composing commit messages in the main editor for those not into the whole brevity thing.

### Find and Replace

[Context lines](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/pull/908) are now optionally displayed with Find in Project results. You can set the number of available lines before and after matches in the package settings and modify their display inline when looking at the results.

## Atom 1.21 Beta

![Atom Beta](/assets/images/blog.atom.io/img/release-beta.png)

Today's beta release of Atom 1.21 features Language Server Protocol support, the first of many deeper language integration features, which we're calling [Atom IDE](https://atom.io/ide). It also includes a new, unified filesystem watcher API and build status indicators.

### Language Server Integration and Atom IDE

Atom's been straddling the fence between text editor and IDE for years. We've come to believe that a benefit of Atom's hyper-modular architecture is that users who want more IDE features can have them without affecting the experience of those who don't. Atom 1.21 takes the first step down this path with [Language Server Protocol](http://langserver.org/) support and ready-made integrations with five existing language servers. Check out the [Atom IDE post](announcing-atom-ide.html) for details.

### Filesystem Watcher API

Atom and its ecosystem of packages use a number of npm packages to watch the file system for changes. As we worked on the Git integration and Language Server support this patchwork approach left us wanting something simpler and more reliable across platforms. Atom 1.21 includes the first version of this new API. While the underlying implementation is still under development the API itself is stable and ready for use and feedback from package authors.

### More GitHub PR Events and Build Status

The GitHub integration continues to get richer in this release. We've added new PR timeline events and PR build status.

### Other Notable Changes

- [MacOS native tabs](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14711) are now supported.
- We [restored Atom's ASAR archive](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14682) to improve performance in several scenarios, most notably installation on Windows.
- Lots of language-specific grammar improvements were made, including the [addition of TypeScript](https://github.com/atom/language-typescript).
