Atom is a big projectâ€”it comprises nearly 100 repositories and includes the core of the editor itself, the Atom Shell application framework and 77 bundled packages. It can sometimes be a challenge to understand everything that's going on at a high level. That's why we've added a public roadmap to atom.io. There you'll find an overview of what's currently shipping, as well as work that's in progress and on deck.

The roadmap is a high level overview of what's going on in the project. Rather than keeping track of every last bug we fix and feature we tweak, it features big things we plan to work on in the near-to-medium term.

Each item is linked to an issue in the Atom organization, so you can easily join the conversation at the most relevant place. We've also grouped roadmap projects in categories like _api-freeze_ and _1.0_. The page will change as issues are created and closed, so it will continue to be a good place to follow development even after our current goals are completed.

The goal of the roadmap today is to lead us to Atom 1.0. If you're interested in taking a look at what's coming in 1.0 at higher level of detail, check out our [1.0 tracking issue on the Atom repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3684).
