Since its initial launch, the documentation for Atom has been limited to a simple collection of guides stored in the main Atom repository. We have long been wanting to split that out into a proper documentation project.

Over the last few months, we've spent some time expanding and re-organizing that content into a fully structured book on Atom and splitting it out into its own repository which you can now find at [atom/docs](https://github.com/atom/docs).

Though it's not yet fully complete, we wanted to open the effort to the community as soon as possible so anyone interested can join in. If you occasionally like to unleash your inner scribe and you know how Atom works behind the scenes a bit, we would [love your help](https://github.com/atom/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!

The new documentation has been converted to [Asciidoc](http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/) and is now being automatically converted into ePub, mobi and PDF formats on every build, in case you want to read it on the go or print the whole thing out.

Any changes to the book will also be automatically built and pulled into Atom.io with a new table of contents sidebar for easy browsing.

We also took the opportunity to create a new [documentation landing page](https://atom.io/docs/) for  Atom.io. This new page points to the various places you can learn about how to Atom with the best of them.

We hope you find this new documentation effort helpful and if you're interested in getting involved with documenting some of the amazing things that people are doing with Atom, please [help us out](https://github.com/atom/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Our work on the Atom Flight Manual is far from complete.
