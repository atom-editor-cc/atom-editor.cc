Atom 1.31 is out, improving usage metrics, Tree-sitter, Tree view and providing more pull request details.

<!--more-->

### Tree-sitter

Tree-sitter grammars can now more reliably detect file languages based on the first line of content, enabling common detection scenarios like vim modelines or shebang lines without producing spurious identifications as easily.

All Tree-sitter grammars use their original TextMate scope names. This reduces the number of changes in user packages needed to transition to supporting Tree Sitter and eases the path to enabling Tree Sitter in Atom as the default grammar provider.

The JavaScript Tree-sitter grammar highlights regular expressions in your code. Also, Tree-sitter grammars for JavaScript and Ruby have been improved to more accurately highlight special variables and tokens.

### Tree View improvements

Tree View has received many improvements such as the ability to add project folders using drag and drop from your file explorer, support for dragging multiple items to move them, and adding custom styles for ignored files and directories. Git status for project folders is now reflected in the color of the project name. Keyboard navigation with arrow keys in the Tree View behaves more predictably with nested folders. Also, `hideIgnoredNames` and `hideVcsIgnoredFiles` play nicely together.

All these improvements were made by Atom community members. Big thanks to [@denis-sokolov](https://github.com/denis-sokolov), [@synthetiv](https://github.com/synthetiv), [@captin411](https://github.com/captin411), [@50Wliu](https://github.com/50Wliu), [@ungb](https://github.com/ungb), [@anderoonies](https://github.com/anderoonies), [@uzitech](https://github.com/uzitech), and [@viddo](https://github.com/viddo)! ![:heart:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2764.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":heart:"}

### Usage Metrics improvements

We have completely replaced Google Analytics. If you have opted in to usage metrics (thank you!) all data is now flowing through GitHub's internal analytics pipeline instead. For more details on these metrics changes, check out this [blog post](/blog/2018/06/20/atom-metrics).

### More Pull Request details in the GitHub Package

The GitHub package displays the username, branch, and repository of each pull request in the pull request detail pane.

Furthermore, as a follow-up to the recent [redesign of the GitHub tab](/blog/2018/08/28/atom-1-30#view-and-check-out-pull-requests), we have removed the "preview" suffix from its title.

- [atom/github#1602](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1602) _Remove "(preview)" from the GitHub tab title_

## Atom 1.32 Beta

### Tree-sitter is enabled by default

Our improved parsing system, Tree-sitter, is on by default on our beta channel. Tree-sitter will bring more powerful syntax highlighting and improved fold behavior based on a full, asynchronous incremental parse of the source file, replacing the TextMate-based parsers that Atom has relied upon since launch for a select few languages. Initially, we're supporting Bash, C, C++, `.erb`, `.ejs`, Go, HTML, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and TypeScript.

Tree-sitter has been available behind a configuration option for some time now, but we are now confident enough in its stability to use it as the primary grammar provider.

Special thanks to everyone who enabled it early and reported crashes and bugs. If you'd like to help us bring the power of Tree-sitter to more languages, check out [the Tree-sitter documentation](http://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/).

### Significant RAM usage improvement

Thanks to some sleuthing by [@maxbrunsfeld](https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld), Atom's main and renderer processes now consume _45MB_ less RAM each!

To generate the [V8 snapshot](https://v8.dev/blog/custom-startup-snapshots) that substantially accelerates Atom's startup time, we pre-process all source code with a tool called [`electron-link`](https://github.com/atom/electron-link). `electron-link` automatically eliminates certain code constructs that wouldn't work properly within the snapshot, but it also concatenates all of the source into a single string. V8 keeps the raw source around, along with some companion data structures to calculate line ending offsets, but we don't use it anywhere. By minifying the source blob, we can greatly reduce its fingerprint in memory without losing any functionality.
