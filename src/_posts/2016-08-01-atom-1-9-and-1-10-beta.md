## 1.9 Stable

The following is a summary of improvements we have been testing on our beta channel and that are finally landing in Atom 1.9.0. ![:rocket:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f680.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":rocket:"}

- [Display Layers](https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/pull/149), which are going to bring speed improvements as well as new features like free-form folds (via the `Fold Selection` command) and an improved soft-wrapping algorithm.
- [Electron Upgrade (v0.37.8)](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11474), which features many performance improvements and enables efficient ligatures rendering on all the platforms.
- [Drag and Drop Layout Management](https://github.com/atom/tabs/pull/252), that provides a very intuitive way for organizing the workspace.
- [Enhanced Reliability When Saving Files](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11828), which minimizes the risk of losing files when a hard crash occurs.
- [Shell Commands](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11762) [Compatibility On Windows](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11833), that makes the `atom` command compatible with both Cygwin and Msys.

### Removal of GitRepositoryAsync

Earlier this year, we added an experimental async API for interacting with Git repositories based on libgit2 called `GitRepositoryAsync`. We never officially made this API public, but some package authors started using it anyway based on examples in our bundled packages.

Unfortunately, our bindings to libgit2 were causing Atom's helper processes to become unstable, leading to hard crashes. We apologize to any package authors who may have switched to these new APIs, but we've been forced to back out the async APIs. We'll be trying again soon with a new approach for interacting with Git that's more stable.

For a more comprehensive list of improvements and bug fixes, please check out the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.9.0)! ![:memo:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":memo:"}

## 1.10 Beta

This version features performance and stability improvements and, in particular, we are very excited to announce that `apm` has been upgraded: package installation and development should be much smoother in this release! ![:zap:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/26a1.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":zap:"}

### Atom Package Manager Upgrade

We've worked through some challenges with our internal builds that were holding back a much-needed upgrade to `apm`. The new version ships with `Node 4.4.5` and `npm 3.10.5`, and solves a variety of issues that occurred when installing Atom packages, for instance:

- Package dependencies are now flattened by npm 3, preventing problems with paths exceeding the maximum path length on Windows.
- Packages that depend on native modules now install more reliably.
- Installing packages behind proxy servers should work now.

Don't forget to check out all the other improvements shipping with this version in the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.10.0-beta0)! ![:memo:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":memo:"}
