The Atom community has been busy with creating new [packages](/packages) since [the last package roundup](/blog/2014/08/08/new-package-roundup), so here are a few of those to try out. If you notice any new and interesting packages, [let us know](https://twitter.com/atomeditor)!

## [Git Log](/packages/git-log)

This neat package by [@nikhilkalige](https://github.com/nikhilkalige) displays a rendering of the Git log graph right within Atom, together with commit related information.

## [Key Peek](/packages/key-peek)

[@batjko](https://github.com/batjko) created this slimmed-down version of the built-in [Keybinding Resolver package](/packages/keybinding-resolver). This package shows only the matched keybinding and adds some nice styling to the sections.

## [Git History](/packages/git-history)

[@jakesankey](https://github.com/jakesankey) brings us a package which lists the Git log history for the active file, and allows opening previous versions in another tab.

## [Stacktrace](/packages/stacktrace)

Given a stacktrace from a supported language (currently Ruby, JavaScript and CoffeeScript), this package gives you a view of the full trace, with a few lines of context on each stack frame, and navigation tools to walk up and down the stack while you're looking at the full files. Great work, [@smashwilson](https://github.com/smashwilson)!

## [Pen Paper Coffee Syntax Theme](/themes/pen-paper-coffee-syntax)

This syntax theme was created by [@nylki](https://github.com/nylki) specifically for writing papers in Markdown. It features a beautiful paper-like color scheme and increased font-size for headings.

## [Git Tab Status](/packages/git-tab-status)

Another one by [@jakesankey](https://github.com/jakesankey) and backed by Git data, this package adds the ability for open tabs to reflect the Git status of those files.

## [Live Archive](/packages/live-archive)

[@mark-hahn](https://github.com/mark-hahn) created this amazing feature-packed package which provides VCR-like controls for inspecting previous versions of files and their diffing. Version snapshots are created automatically on each file save, stored on disk and compressed.
