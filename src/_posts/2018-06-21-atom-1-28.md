Atom 1.28 is out now, providing many new fixes and improvements including a more context-aware Find-In-Project results view and support for custom color profiles. It's also using the new Electron 2.0 which provides new APIs and many performance and stability improvements.

### Improved Find-in-Project results view

Thanks to a [pull request](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/pull/1002) from [@PoignardAzur](https://github.com/PoignardAzur), the Find-in-Project results view now groups adjacent matches in the same file and highlights multiple matches on the same line. This makes it much easier to understand the context around the matches:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>**Before**</th>
      <th>**After**</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>![before-results-view](/assets/images/user-images.githubusercontent.com/8573618/37409962-ecbec81a-27e2-11e8-8cee-24d33c4dc965.png)</td>
      <td>![after-results-view](/assets/images/user-images.githubusercontent.com/8573618/39080692-fa5307a8-456e-11e8-831f-539e889bb839.png)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Electron upgrade

Under the hood, Atom 1.28 includes an upgrade from Electron 1.7.11 to [2.0.3](https://electronjs.org/releases#2.0.3), delivering a healthy batch of stability and performance improvements. This also upgrades Atom's Node.js from 7.9.0 to 8.9.3 and Chromium from 58 to 61, providing many new API improvements.

### Support for custom color profiles

Photographers, designers, and other users will often calibrate their monitors colors using a [color profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_profile). Atom now automatically honors these profiles when rendering colors. ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

#### Customize to your liking

We anticipate that most users will appreciate this enhancement, but given Atom's emphasis on hackability, we naturally want to give you the choice for how Atom should respond to your monitor's color profile.

If you decide that you prefer Atom's previous color rendering, there's a new Atom setting just for you. Inside the [Settings View](https://flight-manual.atom-editor.cc/getting-started/sections/atom-basics/#settings-and-preferences), find the _Color Profile_ setting, choose _Use sRGB color profile_, and then restart Atom to allow the change to take effect.

### GitHub package improvements

Commit message preprocessing has been [substantially revisited](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1500), preserving newlines in amended commits, preserving `#` comments in commits composed within the mini editor, and respecting your `commit.cleanup` configuration when committing from an expanded editor.

"Large" file patches are identified by [byte count, not line count, of the patch body](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1501). This prevents performance hiccups when navigating past files with large diffs in a relatively small number of lines.

[Avatars are now supported](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1483) for users who are using the [newer-style anonymized email addresses](https://help.github.com/articles/about-commit-email-addresses/).

Modal dialogs can now be [cancelled properly by pressing <kbd>esc</kbd> on Windows](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1452)

Don't forget to check out all the other improvements shipping with Atom 1.28 in the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.28.0)! ![:memo:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":memo:"}

## Atom 1.29 Beta

### Tree-sitter performance improvements

We're making steady progress on Atom's experimental [new parsing system](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16299), [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter). This month we completed one of the last major steps on the road toward enabling Tree-sitter by default: all parsing is now [performed on a background thread](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/17339). This frees up more time on the main thread, improving Atom's responsiveness and ensuring that parsing can never impact the frame rate:

If you use one of the [languages that Tree-sitter supports](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/#available-parsers) you can try it out by checking the `Use Tree-sitter Parsers` box in the settings view. And if you want to work on adding support for more languages, we'd love your help! Check out the [Tree-sitter documentation](http://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter) for more information.

### GitHub package improvements

The GitHub package now [fetches co-author suggestions](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1476) by querying the GitHub API for users that are mentionable in any of the remotes of the local repo. This allows you to autocomplete by GitHub username. You can also exclude individuals from future co-author suggestions by pressing <kbd>Shift + Del</kbd> when the author is highlighted in the suggestion list.

![co-author username completion](/assets/images/user-images.githubusercontent.com/17565/41681810-be73e748-74a3-11e8-87ed-f0dc62bf3b27.gif)

There are many more details in the [release notes](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.29.0-beta0).
