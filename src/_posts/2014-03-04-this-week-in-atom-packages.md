It hasn't even been a week and we've already seen a lot of amazing packages emerge from the Atom community! Some are super useful and others areâ€¦ well, useful if you want to blow up your code.

## [Atom-jshint](/packages/atom-jshint) by [Joezo](https://github.com/Joezo)

This package uses the amazing [jshint](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jshint) node module to visually display JavaScript errors in realtime. Never forget a trailing semicolon again! But if you want to live the semicolon-free lifestyle don't worry. The package also respects `.jshintrc` files so you can disable any warnings you don't care about. Read more about it on [atom.io](/packages/atom-jshint).

## [Rdio](/packages/Rdio) by [EtienneLem](https://github.com/EtienneLem)

While the [Spotify](/packages/atom-spotify) package is pretty cool, the Rdio package cranks it up to 11! Not only can you play or pause your music, but you can add the current song to your collection or sync it to your mobile device! And it also adds a fancy little equalizer to your status bar. Read more about it on [atom.io](/packages/Rdio)

## [Prettify](/packages/atom-prettify) by [adambutler](https://github.com/adambutler)

There is nothing worse than poorly formated HTML. Seriously, nothing. Thankfully there are HTML prettifiers! Just select some ugly HTML and run the `prettify` command from the command palette and everything will be right in the world. Read more about it on [atom.io](/packages/atom-prettify).

## [Block Travel](/packages/block-travel) by [leejarvis](https://github.com/leejarvis)

Block travel lets you jump between blocks of code using `alt-up` and `alt-down`. It's a simple concept that turns out to be surprisingly useful, especially when you realize it works with selections by using `alt-shift-up` and `alt-shift-down`. Also, @leejarvis gets bonus points for [writing package specs](https://github.com/leejarvis/block-travel/blob/master/spec/block-travel-spec.coffee)! Read more about it on [atom.io](/packages/block-travel)

## [asteroids](/packages/asteroids) by [mojombo](https://github.com/mojombo)

We've all wanted to destroy some piece of code, but deleting it isn't satisfying enough. Justice demands that code feel the same pain it has inflicted upon us. Luckily some dude named [mojombo](https://github.com/mojombo) whipped up a package to help annihilate code and quench our digital bloodlust. Read more about it on [atom.io](/packages/asteroids)
