At this time, Facebook has decided to retire their open source efforts on Nuclide, the Atom-IDE, and other associated repos.

As the hackable text editor, Atom has always been a place where individuals or teams can create interesting packages that help customize and tailor a developer's workflow. Atom has shown this level of flexibility and extensibility by being the platform where contributors can build on top of the editor, ranging from robust IDEs to simple keyboard shortcuts. The packages have proved to be incredibly powerful and can change everything from the look and feel of the entire interface, to the basic operation of core functionality.

A few years ago, Facebook introduced Nuclide to provide a first-class IDE experience which included associated repos such as Atom IDE. Both Nuclide and Atom IDE were developed by Facebook and supported by an open source community. At this time, Facebook has decided to retire their open source efforts on Nuclide, the Atom IDE, and other associated repos. All of the source code will remain available in the Facebook Open Source Archives, and, if you're interested, we encourage you to check it out and continue to build on top of it. More details at [Nuclide.io](https://nuclide.io/).

GitHub remains committed to developing and supporting Atom. We understand that while languages change and careers progress, choosing an editor to grow with is one of the most personal decisions a developer makes. Atom is home to many developers, and we look forward to continuing to make enhancements and build with the community.

Thanks for reading, and for being a part of the Atom community!
