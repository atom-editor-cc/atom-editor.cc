Packages make Atom work. We've noticed that it can be sometimes difficult to find packages and adjust their settings, so we've made some changes to Atom's settings view in version 0.167.0 that will help you manage your packages and themes more easily. Packages and themes now have their own tabs, organized by community packages you've installed, core packages that ship with Atom, and packages that you're developing.

You can filter these lists with a fuzzy search form at the top of the page, and they will remain grouped by type:

Searching for new packages and updating installed packages get their own tabs as well. Also, anywhere a package is shown in a list, you have quick and easy access to settings and management tasks, as well as download counts and version information.

Also, the settings view now is now themable, so if you have a favorite UI theme, you'll have a settings view to match!

If you'd like to follow along with settings view development or give feedback on these changes, the [atom/settings-view repository](https://github.com/atom/settings-view) is the place to do it.
