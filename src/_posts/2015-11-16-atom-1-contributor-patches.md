To celebrate our 1.0 release at the end of June this year, we produced a
limited-edition patch for people that contributed to the editor leading up to this important milestone.

We started showing a message at the top of [atom.io](/) to users eligible for the patch letting them know that we wanted to send them something special. Until today, we haven't publicized it any further, because we wanted it to be a nice surprise. ![:gift_heart:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f49d.png){.emoji width="20" height="20" title=":gift_heart:"} We've sent out quite a few patches already, but before we stop producing them we wanted to let everyone know, so that contributors eligible to receive a patch don't miss out.

So, if you:

- Published a package to [atom.io](/packages) before Atom 1.0 was released on June 25, or
- contributed to [atom/atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) or one of its bundled core packages before that date

â€¦ you should see a header on the site that looks like this:

![atom.io patch-eligible account header](/assets/images/blog.atom.io/img/posts/patch-header.png)

If you contributed pre-1.0 and you don't see this header after logging in, feel free to [get in touch](/contact). We will collect addresses through the end of November, and after that we won't ever make this patch again.
