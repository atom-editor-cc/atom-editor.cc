### GitHub package improvements

Pair programming enthusiasts rejoice: the GitHub package now supports adding multiple [co-authors](https://blog.github.com/2018-01-29-commit-together-with-co-authors/" title="learn more about co-authorship on GitHub.com) to [any commit](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1355" title="pull request for the co authors feature). You can search by name or email to add previous committers as co-authors. If your co-author hasn't committed to the current repository before, don't worry - you can still [give them the credit they deserve](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1374" title="pull request for adding a new co author).

The _Amend_ functionality, once a checkbox, has now been expanded to an [_Undo_ button and an action on the context menu](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1364) of the recent commit list.

When it comes time to submit your work for review, you now have a quick way to [create a pull request right from the GitHub pane](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1376), pushing any commits if necessary. With just a button click, Atom launches GitHub.com in your browser so that you can fill in the pull request description, assign reviewers, and then submit it.

We've streamlined the experience for [pushing and pulling branches from the status bar](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1308). Now, the action it takes is based on the status of your branch relative to its remote. This should save you a few clicks per day on common remote interactions. You can still access explicit push/pull actions by right-clicking the status bar item.

## Atom 1.28 Beta

### Improved Find-in-Project results view

Thanks to a [pull request](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/pull/1002) from [@PoignardAzur](https://github.com/PoignardAzur), the Find-in-Project results view now groups adjacent matches in the same file and highlights multiple matches on the same line. This makes it much easier to understand the context around the matches:
