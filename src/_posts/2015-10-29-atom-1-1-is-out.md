Today we are excited to announce Atom 1.1.0. It comes with many improvements and marks the first stable release to pass through the new Atom [beta channel](/blog/2015/10/21/introducing-the-atom-beta-channel). Let's dig in.

## The Big Changes in 1.1.0 Stable

### New Approach to Character Measurement

Check out the [pull request](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8811).

Atom needs to measure runs of text on screen to absolutely position the cursor, selections, highlights, and overlay decorations such as the autocomplete suggestion box. Chrome does not have a text measurement API at this time, so we need to measure text from the DOM. The problem with measuring from the DOM is that it forces a reflow, and these measurement-triggered reflows were a major source of slowness in early versions of Atom.

To solve this, we avoided DOM measurement in most cases when computing pixel positions by caching the widths of each character in different styling contexts. Whenever we needed a horizontal position to absolutely position an element, we iterated through the characters on the relevant line and computed a total based on lookups in our cache.

This avoided any synchronous dependency on the DOM, but it also ignored the important fact that characters can have different widths depending on their context. This is most obviously true with [ligatures](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3821), [emoji](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6307), and [variable-width fonts](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3345), but it started happening even for fixed-width fonts when sub-pixel font scaling was enabled in Chrome, forcing us to patch Electron for a few releases to disable it.

Before settling on our current solution, we tried other ways of getting correct measurements while still avoiding DOM reads, such as measuring text runs [via the canvas API](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6083) or in [an off-screen iframe](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7945). We even contemplated abandoning absolute positioning and tried clever hacks so things could be positioned by the DOM.

But in the end, we settled back on measuring these positions from the DOM directly, this time in a more deliberate and controlled way. Early on, reflows were the bane of our existence, so we really bent over backwards to avoid any forced layouts. It turns out that was too extreme of an approach. We now split our DOM updates into two phases. First, we render everything that doesn't require absolute positioning, then we measure, forcing a reflow. Now, with measurements in hand, we proceed with a second phase of the update. Since we don't mutate the elements we rendered in the first phase, the second layout ends up being less expensive, and by combining this approach with some improvements to our layout and style recalculation times, we found room for direct measurement in our 16ms frame budget.

#### Using Fonts with Ligatures

Now you can use fonts containing [ligatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature) like [monoid](http://larsenwork.com/monoid/), [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) and
[Hasklig](https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig).

After installing a font that supports ligatures, you can enable them by adding the following to [your stylesheet](https://flight-manual.atom-editor.cc/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/):

```css
atom-text-editor {
  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
}
```

This CSS is the minimum to enable ligatures, but there may be more options your font of choice exposes to CSS. Check out [Ligatures & Coding](https://medium.com/@larsenwork/ligatures-coding-fonts-5375ab47ef8e) and [CSS Ligatures](http://ricostacruz.com/til/css-ligatures.html) for more information.

Note that there is a limitation with FiraCode and Hasklig that does not allow placing the cursor between combined ligature characters like `->`. This is a limitation in the Chrome DOM measurement API. [monoid](http://larsenwork.com/monoid/) does not have this limitation due to the way it implements ligatures.

#### Using Variable Width Fonts

You can also use variable width fonts like Helvetica or Times New Roman in Atom's text editor component. Maybe not so interesting in your code editor:

But a number of UI themes like [Unity-UI](/themes/unity-ui) set the mini-editor font to a variable width font. Now this works without cursor positioning problems.

### Reduced GC Pauses When Scrolling Editor

Previous to Atom 1.1.0, Atom was allocating all new DOM nodes for any new text rendered on screen. In this release, we've [implemented a DOM-node pool](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8783) that reuses DOM nodes whenever we can. This creates less pressure on the garbage collector and leads to less GC pauses when using the editor.

We also identified and fixed [a memory leak](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9067) which should help improve our memory situation when scrolling.

### New Fuzzy Search Options

There have been a [number](https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder/issues/57) [of](https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder/issues/41) [reports](https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder/issues/138) [regarding](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/issues/564) the [quality](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/issues/42) of the fuzzy searching algorithm [Atom uses](https://github.com/atom/fuzzaldrin) in fuzzy-finder and autocomplete-plus.

Community member [@jeancroy](https://github.com/jeancroy) has taken on fixing these issues with a new fuzzy matching library called [fuzzaldrin-plus](https://github.com/jeancroy/fuzzaldrin-plus). He has integrated the new library into fuzzy-finder and autocomplete-plus behind a config setting. To turn on the new algorithm, navigate to the settings page for both autocomplete-plus and fuzzy-finder, then check the "Use Alternate Scoring" setting.

If you have issues with the new scoring algorithm, please let us know by submitting an issue on the [fuzzaldrin-plus](https://github.com/jeancroy/fuzzaldrin-plus) repo.

### Themed Markdown Preview

Markdown preview [now adapts](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview/pull/298) to the installed syntax theme.

Maybe you would rather have the preview match GitHub's markdown rendering? Markdown preview now has a "Use GitHub.com styles" setting that uses a white background and GitHub styles no matter the syntax theme.

## Available now in Atom 1.2.0-beta

Along with the new stable release, we've [rolled the changes](/blog/2015/10/21/introducing-the-atom-beta-channel) from the master branch into a new beta release. You can [install the beta](/beta) to get these features right now. We'll get into more detail when we release 1.2.0 stable, but here is a preview.

### CJK softwrap

Atom now properly wraps CJK characters!

![cjkwrap](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/10524695/31cfbf36-7381-11e5-981b-114a0cafee7c.gif)

See [the PR](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9162) for more details.

### Upgrade to Electron 0.34.x

This brings Atom up to the latest version of Electron and fixes a couple of [pretty](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3593) [bad](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7061), long-standing bugs.

See the PRs for more information: [atom/atom#8779](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8779) and [atom/atom#9184](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9184).

### Custom Package Testing Environment

Want to run your package specs with something other than jasmine 1.3? Now you can specify your own test runner. See [the PR](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8968) and [the portential docs](https://github.com/atom/docs/pull/133) for more information. Note that this is still in flux!

### Settings Have Nice Descriptions

Many of the settings in the settings view lacked descriptions which lead to confusion. In the latest beta, descriptions have been added to all core settings and all settings from bundled packages.
